## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Use this at your own risk!

### Using Git and stow script

[Important: I'm still working on the install scripts so they won't work yet.] You can clone this repository whenever you want. (I keep it in `~/dotfiles` and use stow to link the config files.) The script will also install all the needed  packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantumr8/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source install.sh
```

To update, `cd` into `dotfiles` repository and run:

```bash
source update.sh
```
