## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Use this at your own risk!


### Additional downloads
Nerd font is required for powerline10k to work. You can use any nerd font but I picked this one [`Hack bold`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/Hack/Bold/complete/Hack%20Bold%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf)

### Using Git and stow script

[Important: I'm still working on the install scripts so they won't work yet.] You can clone this repository whenever you want. (I keep it in `~/.dotfiles` and use stow to link the config files.) The script will also install all the needed packages.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantumr8/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source install.sh
```

To update, `cd` into `dotfiles` repository and run:

```bash
source update.sh
```
